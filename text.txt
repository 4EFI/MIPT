Give me the main idea of this text:

II. Read the text and check you ideas, do not pay attention to the gaps. 

(1) ______________ All religions are based on  understanding that one or more gods created everything - the skies, the earth, and the waters. At some stage of the creation process they also made men and women. Humans were seen as helpless creatures who completely depended on good will of the gods. It was only very recently in history that this understanding changed. Men and women became creators and gods became products of their imagination. It is difficult to find out when and where these ideas first appeared - in Greece or China two and a half millennia ago, or in Florence two thousand years later. It does not matter much. The fact is that it happened quite recently in the long history of the human race.

So, our views of the relationship between gods and humans were changed radically. It is not difficult to see why this happened. When the first myths of creation appeared, humans were really helpless. (2) _________________________ They had no idea how to explain what they saw around themóthe rising and setting of the sun, the movement of stars, the changing seasons. Then, slowly at first, and much faster in the last thousand years or so, we began to see how things work. People understood a lot: from microbes to planets, from the circulation of blood in the human body to ocean tide. Humans did not seem to be helpless after all. Humans became creative. Great machines were built, energies conquered, the whole face of the earth was transformed by human skills and efforts and curiosity.

(3) ____________________________  It can help humanity or cause its destruction. Still, we should realize our responsibility for this new role. The gods were both builders and destroyers. The whole world lived in an unstable balance between the godsí kindness and anger. Todayís world also exists between two opposites: creation and destruction. This time, though, not gods, but people do them both. 

We do not know where creativity will lead us. People now want to become the main power in the world and decide what happens to every form of life on the planet. We cannot be sure what the result will be. But at least we can try to understand better what creativity is and how it works. It is important because our future is now closely connected with it.

This text is the summary of thirty yearsí research on how creative people live and work.  I am convinced that creativity cannot be understood if we look only at the people who generate new ideas. Creative ideas work only if there is somebody to understand, support and implement them.

Creativity is a combination of three elements: a society, a person who brings innovation into this society, and experts who recognize and support this innovation.  A creative idea, product, or discovery cannot exist without these three elements. For example, Vera Rubin is famous for her discoveries in astronomy. She made these discoveries because people had already learned a lot about the universe. So, she could use the results of earlier research. Rubin could not be successful without access to modern large telescopes. (4) ______________________________

Creativity is similar to genetic changes in the process of evolution.  Suddenly because of these changes a new characteristic appears in a child. If this new feature makes this child better, it may then appear in the next generations. Most new features are not useful. So, they may disappear after a few generations. But some of them remain, and so biological evolution continues.

(5) _______________ People are not born with a set of knowledge and skills acquired by previous generations. Each new child needs to learn everything from the very beginning. The analogy to genes in the evolution of culture are units of information that we must learn. It is necessary for the existence of culture. Languages, numbers, theories, songs, recipes, laws, and values are all units of information that we pass on to our children so that they will be remembered. What creative people do is to change these units of information. If many right people see the change as an improvement, it will become part of the culture.

So, to understand creativity it is not enough to know about innovators and inventors. Their role is necessary and important, but it is not enough.

It is not correct to say that Thomas Edison invented electricity or that Albert Einstein discovered relativity. They created new things. But Edisonís or Einsteinís discoveries could not happen without earlier knowledge. (6) ________________________________ Finally, they required mechanisms to inform society about their innovations and to distribute them.

We can be creative every day: have new ideas for business, new recipes for cooking food or ideas about decorating our house. Such everyday creativity with a small ëcí is very important in our lives. But this text is not about it.  To be successful in this kind of creativity, we should first understand Creativity with the capital ëcí.
